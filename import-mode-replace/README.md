ðŸ“š Part of the [Falcoria Documentation](https://falcoria.github.io/falcoria-docs/)

This page is part of the official use case library. It explains the behavior of the `replace` import mode â€” used when you want to **overwrite existing scan results with fresh data**.

Falcoria is a modular scan coordination system. To explore all available modes and understand where they apply (e.g., during scan configuration or manual imports), visit the [Import Modes](https://falcoria.github.io/falcoria-docs/scanledger/import-modes/).

### Import Mode: `replace`

Used for completely replacing scan data for any IPs already in the project. The `replace` mode ensures your project reflects the **most recent authoritative scan**.

---

#### ðŸ“Œ Purpose

Clarify that:

* Existing IPs in the project will be fully replaced.
* All port data and service info for those IPs will be overwritten.
* New IPs not present in the project will be inserted.

---

#### ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

This mode is essential for long-term or frequently updated projects, where **scope changes rapidly** and **old scan results become misleading**. Typical scenarios:

- A system was reconfigured â€” ports opened/closed, services upgraded.
- You fixed an issue and want to verify the result.
- You're maintaining a live asset inventory and need to actualize findings.

`replace` mode ensures that outdated scan results are removed and replaced with the most recent scan output, reflecting the current state of the target systems.

| File                             | IPs Included                              | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`replace1.xml`](./replace1.xml) | 134.209.203.62, 159.223.15.22             | Initial scan â€” full port and service data for both IPs inserted.            |
| [`replace2.xml`](./replace2.xml) | 159.223.15.22, 188.166.121.245            | Replaces data for 159.223.15.22 and inserts a new IP (188.166.121.245).     |

---

#### ðŸ’» Commands

Using [`falcli`](https://github.com/Falcoria/falcli):

```console
# Replace mode import
falcli project ips import --file replace1.xml --mode replace
```

Or using `curl`:

```console
curl 'http://<scanledger>/<project_uuid>/ips/import?mode=replace' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
  --form 'file=@"replace.xml"'
```

Repeat with `replace2.xml`.

---

#### âœ… Expected Result

After each step:

* `replace1.xml` â†’ Project receives 2 full scan results.
* `replace2.xml` â†’ One previously scanned IP is overwritten; one new IP is added.

Use this test to verify that your Falcoria instance correctly replaces old scan results with new ones, rather than merging or skipping them.

#### ðŸ–¥ Output Example

```console
python falcli.py project ips import --file replace1.xml --mode replace
Imported IPs report into project '4d8d98c5-522d-40ff-97a9-51052dfcf39a'. Result: 2 IPs.
```
